# Snap Circuits
---
Snap Circuits is a fun and easy way to build your own circuits and learn about electronics.  The components and wires snap together using the same type of snaps used for clothing.  This makes it fast and easy to assemble and disassemble circuits.  They have full color manuals showing pictures of each of the hundreds of possible projects you can build.
