There are several ways to get your BrainPad connected to the Internet. Probably the easiest way is to use one of the available MikroElektronika Click Boards. Click boards are available for either wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi, LoRa, 3G, 4G, BlueTooth LE) connections. These modules all communicate with the BrainPad using some kind of serial protocal (UART, SPI, or I2C) making them fairly easy to use for the more advanced BrainPad aficionados.

It is also possible to use inexpensive wireless development boards if you are willing to do some soldering. Some of these modules are very inexpensive. For example, there are Wi-Fi development boards available online for $4.00 (USD). While these are generally useful to only the most advanced BrainPad users, at that price you don't have much to lose!
