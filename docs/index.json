You can start by learning drag and drop programming using Microsoft MakeCode and work your way up to the exact same tools used by professional programmers. Some of the more advanced options are listed below. C# (C Sharp) C# is a close cousin the C and C++ and Java which are among the most popular programming languages used by professionals. A general-purpose object-oriented programming language, C# can be used not only to program the BrainPad, but also desktop computers and mobile devices. We use Visual Studio to program in C#, which means not only to you get a world class development environment which is used by the pros, but it's also free! Visual Basic Microsoft Visual Basic is very similar in capabilities to C#. It is a little easier to use than C# (especially for beginners) but is not as widely used. While Visual Basic is a great way to learn programming, C# is more relevant to the world of professional programming. Like C#, we us Visual Studio for Visual Basic programming, so you can get a popular, professional, top quality programming environment for free! Arduino If you are familiar with the Arduino programming environment you can use it to program the BrainPad in C++. We encourage students to learn Visual Studio as it is more widely used professionally, but Arduino has become a very common and widely accepted standard among students, hobbyists, and engineers. Click here to get started with Arduino on the BrainPad . MicroPython You can also program the BrainPad in MicroPython. The BrainPad is a great platform for those who know or wish to learn the Python programming language. The Python computer language emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to write programs using fewer lines of code than most other common computer languages. Click here to get started in MicroPython on the BrainPad . Mbed Mbed is a free online development environment that can be used to program the BrainPad in C or C++ without downloading or installing anything. Mbed is not as friendly a development environment as VisualStudio -- you don't get the TinyCLR operating system or the advanced features and debugging of Visual Studio. The advantage of Mbed is that the entire system is completely web based. There is no software to install, maintain or update on your computer, and it is always available on any computer anywhere in the world. Click here to get started using Mbed with the BrainPad Plain C/C++ You can also write programs from scratch using one of the more traditional C/C++ development tools.

The example circuit below shows an LED connected to the BrainPad. The black lines have been added to show the circuit connections in the breadboard. Breadboards are available in a number of sizes, and many breadboards provide a way to connect them to other breadboards to form larger circuits. The nice thing about breadboards is you can easily create or change circuits without soldering. The drawback is that the connections are not always as reliable as soldering or wire wrapping."

    "keywords": "Introduction to C# (C sharp) It is not a secret that C and C++ are the most popular programming languages among professionals. This is particularly true for programmers that work with small digital systems. C# is the modern cousin of the C and C++ family. Its syntax is very close to JAVA, another very popular programming language. Before you start You should have already installed Visual Studio on your computer as well as the TinyCLR extension. If not, please go to Using Visual Studio with the BrainPad for instructions on how to do so. Also, you need a BrainPad and a micro USB cable to continue. Plug the BrainPad into the USB port of your computer. The red power light on the BrainPad should be on. Hello World The first step is to write some very simple code to see if your BrainPad will respond when we try to program it. This is usually called a \"hello world\" program. This program has already been written and is installed on Visual Studio. It was installed when you loaded the TinyCLR extension. Open Visual Studio. In the File menu select New and then Project to open the \"New Project\" dialog box. In the left panel of the \"New Project\" window you can click on the small triangles to the left of each heading to expand the heading and show the options beneath it. You should see the \"Visual C#\" language listed under the \"Installed\" heading in the left panel of the \"New Project\" window. Under \"Visual C#\" select the \"TinyCLR\" option. In the center panel of the \"New Project\" window select \"BrainPad Application\". At the bottom of the \"New Project\" window you can change the name and location of your application or just stick with the default. When starting out you may wish to click on the Browse button and select the folder \"Desktop\" (in the left panel) to make your application easier to find. Click the OK button on the bottom right of the \"New Project\" window. This will create a new project with some sample code to get you started. Once created, you'll be presented with a Program.cs tab. In the Program.cs tab you should see a short sample program (our \"Hello World\" code). This program is automatically loaded when you first create a new project. The lines in green that begin with two forward slashes ( // ) are called comments. Comments are generally used to describe what the program does. Take a moment to review them. You can create your own comments in a C# program by typing // before any comments you want to add. Comments have absolutely no effect on the program or how it runs. Comments do absolutely nothing and are ignored by the BrainPad. So why use comments? Comments are used to make notes about how a piece of code works. They are very helpful when you go back to your program at a later date to modify it, add to it, or fix it. They are also helpful if another programmer wants to understand or modify your code. While adding comments takes longer intitially, you more than make up for the time spent when you have to maintain your code later -- especially for lengthy or complex programs. Let's run the program now to see the code come to life. If your BrainPad is not connected to your computer with a micro USB cable connect it now. Press the F5 function key or the Start button (shown below) to copy the program from your computer to your BrainPad. Visual Studio will now tell your BrainPad to run the code. A few things will happen and the display will now show the text \"Hello!\" and the light bulb (or LED) will blink. What happened exactly? Our application began by running the BrainPadSetup() function. This function is runs one time, when the application starts, and is used to set things up. In this case, it executed the BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(0, 0, \"Hello!\") line to instruct the display to show the text \"Hello!\" The line BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(0, 0, \"Hello!\") is known as a function call. The name of the funtion is \"DrawTextAndShowOnScreen().\" This function is part of the \"Display\" object, which is part of the \"BrainPad\" object. The items listed in parenthesis (0, 0, \"Hello!\") are called the arguments of the function. In this case the first zero tells the BrainPad to display the text at the left side of the BrainPad display. If this number is increased the text will appear further to the right of the screen. The second zero tells the BrainPad to print the text at the top of the display. If this number is increased the text will be printed lower on the screen. The third arugument, \"Hello!,\" tells the BrainPad what text to display on the screen. After BrainPadSetup() is finished, the application calls BrainPadLoop() . Code placed inside this function is executed in an infinite loop. This is why the code that turns the LED on and then off again and never stops. Making changes to the code Let's try changing the program to print your first name on the display. After deploying the \"hello world\" program to the BrainPad, Visual Studio is in \"debug mode.\" We'll learn more about debug mode later, but for now you need to know that you cannot edit code while in debug mode. To stop debug mode, hit the Stop button (as shown below) or hit Shift F5 . If you try to edit code and see the message \"Managed Compatibility Mode does not support Edit and Continue,\" you are trying to edit code while in debug mode. Just stop debug mode ( Stop button or Shift F5 ) and you can edit your program. Use the mouse to place the cursor after the exclamation point in the BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(0, 0, \"Hello!\") function call (as shown below). This should be in line 11 of the program (line numbers are listed near the left edge of the program). Use the Backspace key to erase \"Hello!\" and type in your first name. Run the program by hitting the F5 key. The display on the BrainPad should now display your first name on the BrainPad. Can you make the BrainPad display your name near the center of the screen? Changing the Light Bulb Code Tip You may be confused by the use of \"light bulb\" (2 words) and LightBulb (1 word). Light bulb (2 words) is correct English. LightBulb (1 word) is a BrainPad object. Object names in a program cannot contain spaces. You will often find that object names and other names in a program cannot be written as proper English because of the rules of the programming language you are using. Let's try to change the way the light bulb flashes. We're going to add two lines of code to the end of the program: BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnBlue(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); Exit debug mode by hitting the Stop button with the mouse or by pressing Shift F5 . Now place the cursor after the last line of code ( BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); ) by pointing and clicking with the mouse as shown below. Now hit the Enter key. This will move the cursor past the last line of the program and create a blank line where you can start typing your code. Now type a \"b\" for BrainPad. You will see a drop down box with a list of objects beginning with the letter \"b.\" You may have to type \"br\" to see BrainPad listed. You can keep typing the word \"BrainPad,\" but the easiest way to complete the word is to hit the period key( . ). This will complete typing the word \"BrainPad\" and place a period after it. You can also use the mouse to select \"BrainPad\" from the list, or hit the Space Bar or Enter key. You can also use the arrow keys to move up and down the list. After \"BrainPad.\" another small window with a list of objects that are part of the BrainPad object will appear. Now start typing the word \"lightbulb.\" Another drop down list will appear. Select \"LightBulb\" from the list. Visual Studio's ability to provide a list of words to complete your code is called \"IntelliSense.\" IntelliSense makes it easier for programmers to enter code and to know which objects are part of the preceeding object. Make your code look like the code in the picture below. Do not forget to put a semicolon ( ; ) after each line of code. The semicolon is used in C# as an end of line indicator. Every line in a C# program (or C or C++ program) must end with a semicolon ( ; ). When your code looks like the above example, hit the F5 key to load the program into the BrainPad and run it. The light bulb should follow the pattern: White for 1 second, off for 1 second, blue for 1 second and repeat. There is no delay between the end of the blue blink and the start of the white blink. Do you know why? Make sure you understand how this code works. Feel free to alter the code with different color light bulb blinks for different durations. LightBulb colors: TurnBlue() TurnGreen() TurnRed() TurnWhite() Can you make to BrainPad light bulb flash like a police car? Slowing Down a Program Copy and paste the code from Example 1 below into your project's 'BrainPadLoop()' between its two curly braces { }. It should look like the screen shot below the sample code. If you select the old code before pasting the new code, you can erase the old program at the same time you put in the new one. Tip Parentheses ( ) and curly braces { } are used differently, do not confuse them. Example 1: BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); Now, press F5 to run the code. You should see the light bulb turn green and stay on. This happens because our code is executing faster than we can see. We never see the light bulb actually blink. If you shake the BrainPad while looking at the green light you can see that it is actually blinking very rapidly. Since applications run so quickly, slowing them down can help us solve problems in the program. Slowing down a program can help us see what is happening and see if the code performs as expected. Visual Studio allows us to run code one line at a time. This is called stepping through the code and allows us to see what the application is doing one instruction at a time. Stepping Through Code First, if the debugger is running stop it by pressing the Stop button, hitting Shift F5 , or selecting Stop Debugging in the Debug menu. Add a breakpoint (stop point) at the first line of code inside of BrainPadLoop() by clicking on that line with the mouse and pressing the F9 key as shown below. You can also click in the grey area where the breakpoints appear (at the left edge of the window) to either remove or create new breakpoints. Press F5 to run the application. The project will be built and deployed but then the execution will stop at the breakpoint as shown below. Now hit the F10 key to step through the code one instruction at a time. You can follow the program on the screen and watch the BrainPad light bulb turn green and turn off repeatedly as you hit the F10 key. Single stepping through a program is a very helpful way to see what is happening inside a program and is often used to fix problems within a program. Adding Delays to Code Another way to see what's happening inside a program is to add delays between the instructions. Copy and paste the code below into your project's BrainPadLoop() , between the two curly braces { } . Example 2: BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff(); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); Your code should look like the screen shot below: This program is the same as the previous program (Example 1) except a delay of one second is added after each instruction. Run the code by pressing START and observe the light bulb again. It should now blink green much more slowly than before. More Light Bulb Colors You may have noticed that in addition to the light bulb functions that turns the LED blue, green, red, white and off, there is a function called \"TurnColor()\" which is part of the LightBulb object. The TurnColor() function takes three arguments which describe the color of the light bulb. The first argument tells the light bulb how much red to use, the second how much green, and the third how much blue. Each number is a percentage, or a number from 0 to 100 with 0 being off and 100 being full brightness. The code in the Example 3 shows how this function is used. Copy the code and paste it into BrainPadLoop() between the two curly braces { } . Now run the code. The light bulb should cycle through colors starting at red, ending at white, and then repeating. The light bulb should also get progessively brighter with red being the dimmest color and white being the brightest. Also, the name of each color should appear on the BrainPad display. The color names should start a the top of the screen and move down the screen. Study the code to figure out how it works. Feel free to modify the code to experiment with the light bulb and the display. Example 3: BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(45, 0, \"Red\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(1, 0, 0); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(35, 8, \"Green\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 2, 0); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(40, 16, \"Blue\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 0, 5); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(29, 24, \"Yellow\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(10, 10, 0); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(41, 32, \"Cyan\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 20, 20); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(25, 40, \"Magenta\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(50, 0, 50); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2); BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(37, 48, \"White\"); BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(100, 100, 100); BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2);"

Visual Studio is the most popular desktop program development environment and is used by professional programmers the world over. The experience you gain programming the BrainPad in Visual Studio also applies to programming desktop computers and smart phones, and Visual Studio's advanced debugging and code completion features make writing code a breeze! Step 1: Install Visual Studio on your computer. Skip this step if you already have Visual Studio installed on your computer. The Visual Studio Community Edition is free and can be found here: Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. Click on the above link an then click on the Download VS Community 2017 button. After downloading is complete, run the file. If you are asked, allow the program to make changes to your device. When the installation program shows the \"Workloads\" screen, select .NET desktop development (you should see a check mark in the .NET desktop development box) and then click the Install button. After installation is complete, click on the Launch button. You will be asked to sign in or sign up for Visual Studio developer services. You can either sign in (or sign up) now or click the \"Not now, maybe later\" option. You will then be asked to pick a color scheme and Visual Studio will start. Step 2: Install the TinyCLR extension. If you don't have the TinyCLR extension installed on your computer install it now. If Visual Studio is open, close it before continuing with the TinyCLR installation. The link to the GHI Electronics download page is here: GHI Electronics Download Page Click on the above link and under \"Visual Studio Project System\" click on the latest release in the top row of the table (v0.6.0 when this document was written). When asked, open the file. If you are asked, allow the program to make changes to your device. In the \"VSIX Installer\" dialog box click the Install button. Step 3: Start Visual Studio and Check for TinyCLR. Start Visual Studio. Click on the File menu, then click on New and then Project . The \"New Project\" dialog box will open. The small triangle to the left of each heading in the left column of the dialog box will expand (or show) the options underneath it. Under the \"Installed\" heading you should find the \"Visual C#\" and \"Visual Basic\" programming languages listed. Under each of these languages you should see the \"TinyCLR\" option. Congratulations! You have successfully installed Visual Studio and the TinyCLR extension. You can now start programming the BrainPad by picking a language (Visual C# or Visual Basic) and clicking on the link below. We recommend that students with no programming experience start with C# (C sharp). C# is more like C and C++, which are the most widely used programming languages and are the foundation of many university computer science programs. However, if you have previous BASIC programming experience you may want to start with Visual Basic. Visual Basic can be a little easier to work with and is also a very powerful and capable programming language. Starting with C#, however, may make it easier to learn C or C++ later.

Guidelines Prerequisites: None Ages 12 and up PC setup with Visual Studio 2017, TinyCLR OS and Nuget packages installed. Supplies: BrainPad and Micro USB cable. Arguments Arguments are values passed on to methods. For example, to set the frequency of the buzzer, a value is passed on to that method. The 3000 is the arguments. BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(3000) Arguments are also used when adding delays. Here, the 0.2 is the argument. BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) Variables can be constants, like the numbers used above. They can also be variables, which will be explained in the coming sections. Also, arguments can also be something completely different! Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() 'Declared but not used End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Up) Then BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Up button is pressed\") Else BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Up button is not pressed\") End If End Sub End Class What is that argument used with Button.IsPressed() ? In this case, the Button.IsPressed takes an argument to specify which button is to be checked. This code BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Up) Is much clearer than: BrainPad.Button.IsPressed(4) What is button 4? In fact, internally the up button may be number 4 but remembering this will be difficult. Exercise Try to use the wrong argument type then build the project to observe the error messages. Integer Variables Variable is a location in memory that is reserved for us to use. Instead of knowing where the memory is and how it is located, the system gives us an access to that memory using a name we select. Dim count As Integer The above line instructs the system to reserve (Dim) a variable that is named count and the variable type is an Integer. The name can be use any letters from the alphabet and any numbers but it must not start with a number and it can�t contain spaces. Here are few allowed name examples: Dim count123 As Integer Dim countMeIn As Integer Dim count2var As Integer Variables in small programs can use simply names. It can simply be just x . However, using a meaningful name is very important when writing any serious program, as there maybe tens, or hundreds, of variables. The variable now can store numbers. Note that the variable can be used in the equation and in the result as well. count = count + 2 The above code will add 2 to the count. Math can be used as well. count = 5 + result After selecting an appropriate name, an appropriate type is needed. The type tell the system how much memory to reserve for that one variable. The most widely used variable is an Integer, and can hold very large numbers, even negative numbers. We suggest the use for Integers for everything, except when fractions are needed. More on fractions later. Changing Tones Use the code below: Class Program Dim frequency As Integer Dim increment As Integer Public Sub BrainPadSetup() frequency = 0 increment = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() Then increment = 100 End If If BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed() Then increment = -100 End If If increment <> 0 Then frequency = frequency + increment increment = 0 BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(frequency) BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(frequency.ToString()) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop() End If End Sub End Class The previous example loops 5 times every second and sets the buzzer to a frequency. The frequency is a variable, also named frequency in this example. The buttons will be checked and when the up button is pressed the frequency is incremented by 100 and when the down button is pressed the frequency is decremented by 100. The value held by the frequency variable is also printed using the Debug.Print statement. Can we now determine the highest frequency a person can hear? The if-statement with Variables The same way the if-statement was used to check if a button was pressed, it can be used with variables. If frequency is larger than 6000 then turn the red light off, else turn the red light off. Add this code inside the while-loop in the previous code example. If frequency > 6000 Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnRed() Else BrainPad. LightBulb.TurnOff() End If Exercise Add a variable that starts at 0 and then it is incremented by 1 in every loop. Once the variable reaches 1000, turn the LightBulb yellow. Print the variable value on the output window and make sure its incrementing, then verify the LightBulb turns yellow when the variable go over 1000. Inspecting Variables Printing the variable value worked well for small programs with a single variable. It is not practical to continuously print every variable out. Instead, we can use the debugger feature to pause the code and inspect variables. Class Program Dim count As Integer = 0 Dim increment As Integer = 0 Public Sub BrainPadSetup() End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() count = count + 1 BrainPad.DebugPrint(count) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) End Sub End Class Add a breakpoint in the loop in the previous program and step through code. Move the mouse over the count variable and wait a second. A pop up window will come up showing the value of the count variable. The watch windows can be used with important variables that need to be inspected regularly. Locate the watch window and type the variable name in the left sell. This will show the variable value and type. Exercise Run the previous program for few loops, then pause the program, or add a breakpoint. Inspect the value on the watch window. It should be something other than 0. Change the value manually to 0 and then re-run the program and observe how the output window now shows the variable going back counting from 0. Double Variable While an Integer can hold very large numbers, it can�t hold fractions. For example, there is no way to set an integer to 0.5 or 123.8. The variable type Double should be used whenever fractions are needed. Why not use a Double variable since it can hold large numbers and fractions? You can, but it requires more memory and processing so it isn't as efficient. Class Program Dim frequency As Double Dim increment As Integer Public Sub BrainPadSetup() frequency = 0 increment = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Button.IsUpPressed() Then increment = 100 End If If BrainPad.Button.IsDownPressed() Then increment = -100 End If If increment <> 0 Then frequency = frequency + increment increment = 0 BrainPad.Buzzer.Start(CType(frequency, Integer)) BrainPad.WriteMessageOnComputer(frequency) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(0.2) BrainPad.Buzzer.Stop() End If End Sub End Class The previous example uses a Double instead of an Integer for the frequency. Since the Buzzer.Start() method expects an integer, the variable need to be converted using the CType(). This is demonstrating how using Double for everything is not desirable. Time to go back and have fun with our favorite green light! This example will turn the green light on for a specific time, set by a variable called delay. It then turns the light off for the same length of time. Pressing the up and down buttons control the delay variable, causing the light to be on and off for longer or shorter periods. The variable is also printed out using DebugOutput() . Class Program Dim delay As Double Public Sub BrainPadSetup() delay = 0.2 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() If BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Up) Then delay = delay + 0.2 End If If BrainPad.Buttons.IsPressed(BrainPad.Buttons.Button.Down) Then delay = delay - 0.2 End If BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(delay) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(delay) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(delay) End Sub End Class Returned Values Some methods return a value, like when reading the light sensor. This value can be placed into a variable and then the variable can be used with if-statements. We have lights bulb and a light sensor on the BrainPad. Why not turn the light on when it is dark? This can be tested by turning the lights off inside the room or by placing a finger over the light sensor to block the light. Class Program Dim level As Double Public Sub BrainPadSetup() level = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() level = BrainPad.LightSensor.ReadLightLevel() BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(level) If level > 0.5 Then BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOn() Else BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() End If End Sub End Class How do we know what value to use as the threshold on when to turn the light bulb on? This is a perfect example on where inspecting variables is needed. Run the program and test by placing a finger over the light sensor to block the light. This may not work nicely and you need to adjust the threshold from 0.5 to something else. Take a look at the output window to see the light levels to determine what value work best for your needs. Then stop the program, change the threshold and then run the program again to test the results. Exercise Modify the last program to have a way to set the threshold using the up button. Hint, the threshold was a constant before but now it is going to be a variable that is set to whatever the light sensor returns when the button is pressed. Name the variable threshold and make sure it is type Double. Strings A string is a type of variable that holds text. BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Hello World!\") It is important to remember that the integer 2 and the string \"2\" are not the same thing. This maybe the same for us but internally in the system they are very different. Assuming x is an Integer, what value is in variable x? x = 2 + 2 The result is what you expect, 4. But now assume str is a string variable, what is the value of str? str = \"2\" + \"2\" The string is just text, not a number. When adding strings, the result is a string that combines the strings. The result from above is \"22\". This should make more sense if you try this example. str = \"Hello number \" + \"2\" The result is \"Hello number 2\". Note how even a space makes a difference in the last example. This code will generate an error since 2 is a number here not a string. str = \"Hello number \" + 2 ToString() One of the important built in method for variables is the ToString() method. This method will take the value from the variable and converts it into a string. Class Program Dim count As Integer=0 Public Sub BrainPadSetup() count = 0 End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() count = count + 1 BrainPad.DebugOutput(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End Sub End Class The prior example uses a variable type integer that starts at zero and increments by one in every loop. It will then print the variable value in the Output Window. Exercise Show something like this in the output window: Finite while-loops The While loop and BrainPadLoop() have been used extensively so far. The While loop will run while something is true and since we have passed it the value True then it will loop forever. Is this statement true? 1 = 1 Yes 1 equals 1, that is true! So keeping that in mind, we can make a while-loop keep looping forever using this statement. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While 1 = 1 count = count + 1 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class Or True can simply be used. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While True count = count + 1 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class A While loop can also be finite, meaning will stop looping at some point. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While count < 10 count = count + 1 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class What did the last program do? It printed the count from 1 to 10. But count started at 0, not one. Shouldn't it print count 0? Time for debugging (troubleshooting). Start by setting a breakpoint at count = 0 and then step in the code to see what the value of count is (use watch window) and then see why the value 0 was never printed. Think about a fix before looking at the next code. The fix is very easy! Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While count < 10 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) count = count + 1 End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class What about the 10? Shouldn't the program print Count: 10? The answer is in the while-loop. In plain English, it says: run the following code as long as count is less than 10. Since 10 is not less than 10 then 10 will not be printed. The while-loop can be improved like this: While count <= 10 This new statement says run the loop as long as the count is less than or equals to 10. Exercise Write a program the prints all even numbers between 6 to 66. Nesting Some programs will have loops inside loops, or if-statements inside loops, maybe inside other if-statements and more loops! This is called nesting. While programmers should try to keep this simple to understand, nesting is sometimes required. How do we write a program that prints 1 to 10 repeatedly forever? This is accomplished by having two nested while-loops. One that counts 1 to 10, which goes inside another loop that loops infinitely. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 1 While True While count < 10 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) count = count + 1 End While End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class The above program will not work. It will print 1 to 10 one time only then the program will not end and it will not print anything after. Time again for debugging the code to determine what the issue is. Run the program and determine the cause of the error. The fix is simple but try to find it before peeking at the fixed code. Class Program Public Sub BrainPadSetup() Dim count As Integer count = 0 While True count = 1 While count < 10 BrainPad.WriteDebugMessage(\"Count: \" + count.ToString()) count = count + 1 End While End While End Sub Public Sub BrainPadLoop() End Sub End Class Exercise Write a program that prints 0 to 10 repeatedly when the up button is not pressed when it is bright. If it is dark the button doesn�t do anything. Do not use And , instead nest the if-statements."

    "keywords": "Introduction to Visual Basic on the BrainPad Visual Basic is a very popular Microsoft .NET programming language. While being as powerful as other programming languages, it is perhaps a little easier to start with. Visual Basic is more like plain English than other programming languages, for example, and you don't have to type a semicolon (;) at the end of each line like you do with C, C++, and C#. Before you start You should have already installed Visual Studio on your computer as well as the TinyCLR extension. If not, please go to Using Visual Studio with the BrainPad for instructions on how to do so. Also, you need a BrainPad and a micro USB cable to continue. Plug the BrainPad into the USB port of your computer. The red power light on the BrainPad should be on. Hello World The first step is to write some very simple code to see if the BrainPad will respond when we try to program it. This is usually called a \"hello world\" program. This program has already been written and is installed on Visual Studio. It was installed when you loaded the TinyCLR extension. Open Visual Studio. In the File menu select New and then Project to open the \"New Project\" dialog box. In the left panel of the \"New Project\" window you can click on the small triangles to the left of each heading to expand the heading and show the options beneath it. You should see the \"Visual Basic\" language listed under the \"Installed\" heading in the left panel of the \"New Project\" window. Under \"Visual Basic\" select the \"TinyCLR\" option. In the center panel of the \"New Project\" window select \"BrainPad Application\". At the bottom of the \"New Project\" window you can change the name and location of your application or just stick with the default. When starting out you may wish to click on the Browse button and select the folder \"Desktop\" (in the left panel) to make your application easier to find. Click the OK button on the bottom right of the \"New Project\" window. This will create a new project with some sample code to get you started. Once created, you'll be presented with a Program.vb tab. In the Program.vb tab you should see a short sample program (our \"Hello World\" code). This program is automatically loaded when you first create a new project. The lines in green that begin with an apostrophe ( ' ) are called comments, and they generally describe what the code does. Take a moment to review them. You can create your own comments in a Visual Basic program by typing ' before any comments you want to add. Comments have absolutely no effect on the program or how it runs. Comments do absolutely nothing and are ignored by the BrainPad. So why use comments? Comments are used to make notes about how a piece of code works. They are very helpful when you go back to your program at a later date to modify it, add to it, or fix it. They are also helpful if another programmer wants to understand or modify your code. While adding comments takes longer intitially, you more than make up for the time spent when you have to maintain your code later -- especially for lengthy or complex programs. Let's run the program now to see the code come to life. Connect the BrainPad and press the F5 function key or the 'Start' button (shown below). Visual Studio will now tell your BrainPad to run the code. A few things will happen and the display will now show the text \"Hello!\" and the light bulb (or LED) will blink. What happened exactly? Our application began by running the BrainPadSetup() function. This function is runs one time, when the application starts, and is used to set things up. In this case, it executed the BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(0, 0, \"Hello!\") line to instruct the display to show the text \"Hello.\" The line BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(0, 0, \"Hello!\") is known as a function call. The name of the funtion is \"DrawTextAndShowOnScreen().\" This function is part of the \"Display\" object, which is part of the \"BrainPad\" object. The items listed in parenthesis (0, 0, \"Hello!\") are called the arguments of the function. In this case the first zero tells the BrainPad to display the text at the left side of the BrainPad display. If this number is increased the text will appear further to the right of the screen. The second zero tells the BrainPad to print the text at the top of the display. If this number is increased the text will be printed lower on the screen. The third arugument, \"Hello!,\" tells the BrainPad what text to display on the screen. After BrainPadSetup() is finished, the application calls BrainPadLoop() . Code placed inside this function is executed in an infinite loop. This is why the code that turns the LED on and then off again and never stops. Making changes to the code Let's try changing the program to print your first name on the display. After deploying the \"hello world\" program to the BrainPad, Visual Studio is in \"debug mode.\" We'll learn more about debug mode later, but for now you need to know that you cannot edit code while in debug mode. To stop debug mode, hit the Stop button (as shown below) or hit Shift F5 . If you try to edit code and see the message \"Managed Compatibility Mode does not support Edit and Continue,\" you are trying to edit code while in debug mode. Just stop debug mode ( Stop button or Shift F5 ) and you can edit your program. Use the mouse to place the cursor after the exclamation point in the BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(0, 0, \"Hello!\") function call (as shown below). This should be in line 5 of the program (line numbers are listed near the left edge of the program). Use the Backspace key to erase \"Hello!\" and type in your first name. Run the program by hitting the F5 key. The display on the BrainPad should now display your first name on the BrainPad. Can you make the BrainPad display your name near the center of the screen? Changing the Light Bulb Code Tip You may be confused by the use of \"light bulb\" (2 words) and LightBulb (1 word). Light bulb (2 words) is correct English. LightBulb (1 word) is a BrainPad object. Object names in a program cannot contain spaces. You will often find that object names and other names in a program cannot be written as proper English because of the rules of the programming language you are using. Let's try to change the way the light bulb flashes. We're going to add two lines of code to the end of the program: BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnBlue() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1) Exit debug mode by hitting the Stop button with the mouse or by pressing Shift F5 . Now place the cursor after the last line of code ( BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1); ) by pointing and clicking with the mouse as shown below. Now hit the Enter key. This will move the cursor past the last line of the program and create a blank line where you can start typing your code. Now type a \"b\" for BrainPad. You will see a drop down box with a list of objects beginning with the letter \"b.\" You may have to type \"br\" to see BrainPad listed. You can keep typing the word \"BrainPad,\" but the easiest way to complete the word is to hit the period key( . ). This will complete typing the word \"BrainPad\" and place a period after it. You can also use the mouse to select \"BrainPad\" from the list, or hit the Space Bar or Enter key. You can also use the arrow keys to move up and down the list. After \"BrainPad.\" another small window with a list of objects that are part of the BrainPad object will appear. Now start typing the word \"lightbulb.\" Another drop down list will appear. Select \"LightBulb\" from the list. Visual Studio's ability to provide a list of words to complete your code is called \"IntelliSense.\" IntelliSense makes it easier for programmers to enter code and to know which objects are part of the preceeding object. Make your code look like the code in the picture below. When your code looks like the above example, hit the F5 key to load the program into the BrainPad and run it. The light bulb should follow the pattern: White for 1 second, off for 1 second, blue for 1 second and repeat. There is no delay between the end of the blue blink and the start of the white blink. Do you know why? Make sure you understand how this code works. Feel free to alter the code with different color light bulb blinks for different durations. LightBulb colors: TurnBlue() TurnGreen() TurnRed() TurnWhite() Can you make to BrainPad light bulb flash like a police car? Slowing Down a Program Copy and paste the code from Example 1 below into your project's 'BrainPadLoop()'. It should look like the screen shot below the sample code. If you select the old code before pasting the new code, you can erase the old program at the same time you put in the new one. Example 1: BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() Now, press F5 to run the code. You should see the light bulb turn green and stay on. This happens because our code is executing faster than we can see. We never see the light bulb actually blink. If you shake the BrainPad while looking at the green light you can see that it is actually blinking very rapidly. Since applications run so quickly, slowing them down can help us solve problems in the program. Slowing down a program can help us see what is happening and see if the code performs as expected. Visual Studio allows us to run code one line at a time. This is called stepping through the code and allows us to see what the application is doing one instruction at a time. Stepping Through Code First, if the debugger is running stop it by pressing the Stop button, hitting Shift F5 , or selecting Stop Debugging in the Debug menu. Add a breakpoint (stop point) at the first line of code inside of BrainPadLoop() by clicking on that line with the mouse and pressing the F9 key as shown below. You can also click in the grey area where the breakpoints appear (at the left edge of the window) to either remove or create new breakpoints. Press F5 to run the application. The project will be built and deployed but then the execution will stop at the breakpoint as shown below. Now hit the F10 key to step through the code one instruction at a time. You can follow the program on the screen and watch the BrainPad light bulb turn green and turn off repeatedly as you hit the F10 key. Single stepping through a program is a very helpful way to see what is happening inside a program and is often used to fix problems within a program. Adding Delays to Code Another way to see what's happening inside a program is to add delays between the instructions. Copy and paste the code below into your project's BrainPadLoop() . Example 2: BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnGreen() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1) BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnOff() BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(1) Your code should look like the screen shot below: This program is the same as the previous program (Example 1) except a delay of one second is added after each instruction. Run the code by pressing START and observe the light bulb again. It should now blink green much more slowly than before. More Light Bulb Colors You may have noticed that in addition to the light bulb functions that turns the LED blue, green, red, white and off, there is a function called \"TurnColor()\" which is part of the LightBulb object. The TurnColor() function takes three arguments which describe the color of the light bulb. The first argument tells the light bulb how much red to use, the second how much green, and the third how much blue. Each number is a percentage, or a number from 0 to 100 with 0 being off and 100 being full brightness. The code in the Example 3 shows how this function is used. Copy the code and paste it into BrainPadLoop() . Now run the code. The light bulb should cycle through colors starting at red, ending at white, and then repeating. The light bulb should also get progessively brighter with red being the dimmest color and white being the brightest. Also, the name of each color should appear on the BrainPad display. The color names should start a the top of the screen and move down the screen. Study the code to figure out how it works. Feel free to modify the code to experiment with the light bulb and the display. Example 3: BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(45, 0, \"Red\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(1, 0, 0) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(35, 8, \"Green\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 2, 0) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(40, 16, \"Blue\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 0, 5) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(29, 24, \"Yellow\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(10, 10, 0) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(41, 32, \"Cyan\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(0, 20, 20) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(25, 40, \"Magenta\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(50, 0, 50) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2) BrainPad.Display.DrawTextAndShowOnScreen(37, 48, \"White\") BrainPad.LightBulb.TurnColor(100, 100, 100) BrainPad.Wait.Seconds(2)"
