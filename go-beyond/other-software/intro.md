The BrainPad focuses on Start Making (link) with MakeCode and lets you Go Beyond (link) with TinyCLR OS and .NET. However, there are other software options that also work on the BrainPad. We only give you a starting point in case you want to test the other possibilities.

## Arduino <img style="float: right;" src="images/arduino-logo.png">
If you are familiar with the Arduino programming environment you can use it to program the BrainPad in C++.    We encourage students to learn Visual Studio as it is more widely used professionally, but Arduino has become a very common and widely accepted standard among students, hobbyists, and engineers.

## MicroPython <img style="float: right;" src="images/micropython-logo.png">
You can also program the BrainPad in MicroPython.  The BrainPad is a great platform for those who know or wish to learn the Python programming language.  The Python computer language emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to write programs using fewer lines of code than most other common computer languages.

## Mbed <img style="float: right;" src="images/mbed-logo.png">
Mbed is a free online development environment that can be used to program the BrainPad in C or C++ without downloading or installing anything.  Mbed is not as friendly a development environment as VisualStudio -- you don't get the TinyCLR operating system or the advanced features and debugging of Visual Studio.  The advantage of Mbed is that the entire system is completely web based.  There is no software to install, maintain or update on your computer, and it is always available on any computer anywhere in the world.

## Bare Metal
You can also write programs from scratch using one of the more traditional C/C++ development tools.  Many of these tools are available for free.
