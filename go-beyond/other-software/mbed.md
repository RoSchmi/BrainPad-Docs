## Using Mbed with the BrainPad

Mbed is an online compiler platform. There is nothing to install, just log in and start coding!

When using Mbed to program the BrainPad, select the Nucleo-F401RE as your target platform.  The F401RE uses the same processor as the BrainPad.  When you have written and compiled your program, follow the instructions on genearing and loading [DFU Files](../../resources/dfu-files.md).

This video shows how to use Mbed with the BrainPad.
