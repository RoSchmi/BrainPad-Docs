Show picture of BrainPad and point out components. Or show input process output graphic? Doubt you can do BrainPad imagemap in markdown.

The BrainPad has all of its inputs arranged on the left side of the board:
* [Accelerometer](accelerometer.md)
* [Buttons](buttons.md)
* [Light Sensor](light-sensor.md)
* [Temperature Sensor](temperature-sensor.md)

All of the inputs are processed by the "brain" and then sent to the different output devices:
* [Buzzer](buzzer.md)
* [Display](display.md)
* [Light Bulb](light-bulb.md)
* [Servo Motors](servo-motors.md)
