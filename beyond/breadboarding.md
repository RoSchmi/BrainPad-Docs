# Breadboarding
---
This option is only recommended for advanced users with electronics background. 

Solderless breadboards can be used to quickly build and test electrical circuits which can be connected to the BrainPad.  Ciruits are built by just plugging wires and components into the holes (sockets) on the breadboard.  Each hole on the breadboard is connected to the holes next to it as shown below (image coming).

The example circuit below shows an LED connected to the BrainPad.  The black lines have been added to show the circuit connections in the breadboard.

Breadboards are available in a number of sizes, and many breadboards provide a way to connect them to other breadboards to form larger circuits.

The nice thing about breadboards is you can easily create or change circuits without soldering.  The drawback is that the connections are not always as reliable as soldering or wire wrapping.
