## Microsoft MakeCode
Microsoft MakeCode is a great way to learn programming.  MakeCode allows you to drag and drop blocks to create programs while seeing the results on a simulated BrainPad.  MakeCode also has a JavaScript program editor.  When you change your block program MakeCode changes your text (JavaScipt) program for you.  Changes made to the text program will automatically show up as changes to your block program.

The [Microsoft MakeCode website](http://www.makecode.com) has instructions, tutorials, and sample programs.  To get started with Microsoft MakeCode [click here](http://www.makecode.com)
