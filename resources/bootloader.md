# Bootloader
---
The BrainPad bootloader is small program that allows the BrainPad to communicate with your computer.  It comes preinstalled on the BrainPad and you should not have to install it yourself unless you are an advanced programmer using advanced programming techniques.

In the rare case that you need to load the bootloader, follow these 2 steps:
1. Download the desired bootloader DFU file from the [Downloads](downloads.md#bootloader) page. If you are not sure which version you need, use the latest version.
2. Follow the instructions for loading [DFU files](dfu-files.md).
