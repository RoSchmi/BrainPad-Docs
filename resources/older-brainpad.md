# Older BrainPad
---
Some of you, early adopters, have recieved the original BrainPad concepts and prototypes. We thank you for helping us in making the BrainPad the best STEM tool.

We highly recommend switching to the prodiuction BrainPad but if you really want to use your board then this page will explain the diffrences.

# Pre-production BrainPad
(image)
This version is identical to the production BrainPad except for a change on the reset circuitry. You can tell by looking at the reset button. It is a micro button on the pre-production BrainPad.

Pressing and holding the reset button the production BrainPad will put it in the loader mode. To do the same on the pre-production board (with the smaller reset button), press and hold the left button and while holding the reset button, press and release the reset button. Then, wait a second and release the left button. 

In other words, whenever you are instructed to press and hold reset for three seconds, you will do teh above instead.

# Concept Brinpad

This BrainPad was much larger board. You can easilly identify it by the TrafficLight in the top right Corner. This version used the G30 chipset.

Unfortunately, this version only works with TinyCLR OS. It does not work with MakeCode or any other software. We try to keep the the latest TinyCLR OS BrainPad libraries compatible and workable with this board but we highly recommend switching to the production BrainPad.

To use with TinyCLR OS, follow the instructions on the GHI Electronics [G30 support page](http://docs.ghielectronics.com/hardware/scm/g30.html). From here, you can use all C# and VB examples as is or with very minimal changes.

# Other Concepts and Prototypes
There were other rare samples as well. Those are not supported.
